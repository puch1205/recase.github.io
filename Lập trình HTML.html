	WE LOVE TO USE THE LATEST SMARTPHONE AND <br>
	
    WE NEED SOMETHING TO PROTECT OUR BABIES RIGHT? <br>
    
    OF COURSE OUR REAL LOVE IS CASES. WHY, YOU MIGHT ASK? </font> </h3>
    <p> We love cases because for us, itâ€™s our way of making a difference. We started 
    RE:CASE when we learnt that in the US alone, 79% of smartphone users have cases to 
    protect their phones.The global mobile phone protective cover market size is 
    anticipated to reach USD 21.89 billion in 2022 and is expand at compound annual growth
    rate (CAGR) of 8.3% from 2023 to 2030. The increasing penetration of smartphones 
    across the globe is the main factor driving demand for protective cases. However, the 
    environmental protection cases were not yet popular and caused tons of rubbish every 
    year.  </p>
    <p> We thought that was pretty crap. So in Jan 2022, our company launched RE:CASE 
    with a crowdfunding campaign. We delivered our first product in Apr 2023 and have been
    thrilled to keep growing ever since. Not just because our case is gracing people 
    across the country but also because we contribute to improve the world by create 
    eco-friendly products </p>
